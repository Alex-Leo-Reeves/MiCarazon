Yetunde, I'm here to stay now and I won't leave again. It is not a promise but an assurance; what happened before will not happen again. I miss you so much. All the times I spent with you, every moment we had, every time we told each other 'I love you.' Can I be your forever and will you be Mi Carazon? Open your heart for me. What happened before won't happen again. This is how I really feel. I love you, Khaji.";
